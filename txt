I am working in NLP domain for 8+ years 
You SHOULD learn these basics first 👇

Start here before chasing the hype 👇

1️⃣ 𝗙𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀
↳ Mathematics for Machine Learning [Book]
↳ Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow [Book]
↳ (Optional) Introduction to Statistical Learning [Book] — for statistics understanding

2️⃣ 𝗕𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗰 𝗡𝗟𝗣 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝘀
↳ Stopwords, Stemming, Lemmatization
↳ Bag of Words
↳ TF-IDF
↳ BM25
↳ Word2Vec
↳ N-grams
↳ Named Entity Recognition (NER)
↳ Tokenization
↳ Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging

3️⃣ 𝗚𝗲𝘁 𝗙𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗿 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗙𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗲𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀
↳ NLTK
↳ SpaCy
↳ PyTorch (important, more popular now)
↳ (Optional) Hugging Face basics

4️⃣ 𝗨𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀
↳ Word2Vec
↳ GloVe
↳ FastText
(Understand pre-transformer embeddings properly)

5️⃣ 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀 & 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀
↳ Understand how Transformers work
↳ Explore BERT, ModernBERT, DistilBERT, etc.
↳ Learn Sentence-Transformers & Hugging Face
(✍️ Bonus: Understand bi-encoders for retrieval)

6️⃣ 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗘𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀
↳ BLEU Score, ROUGE Score, Perplexity, etc.
↳ Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, etc.
↳ Semantic Similarity evaluations (Cosine similarity, embedding-based metrics)

7️⃣ 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗹𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗲-𝘁𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗳 𝗦𝗺𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀 (𝗲.𝗴., 𝗕𝗘𝗥𝗧)
↳ Fine-tune for classification
↳ Fine-tune for question-answering
↳ Fine-tune for domain-specific embeddings
↳ Understand task-specific heads (classification/QA)
↳ Learn fine-tuning best practices: LR schedules, early stopping, regularization

✅ Master these concepts.
✅ Build 2-3 simple projects using them.
✅ You’ll be ahead of most people chasing fancy stuff.

Keep it simple. Keep it strong. 💪
