    // Describe TCP and UDP protocols.
    // TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transmission
    //  between devices. It establishes a connection before data transfer, guarantees the delivery of packets in the 
    // correct order, and provides error-checking mechanisms. TCP is used for applications where data integrity is 
    // crucial, such as web browsing, email, and file transfers.

    // UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol that does not guarantee reliable data transmission.
    // It sends packets without establishing a connection and does not ensure the order or delivery of packets
    // . UDP is faster than TCP and is used for applications where speed is more important than reliability, such as
    //  video streaming, online gaming, and voice over IP (VoIP).


    // difference between process and thread
    // A process is an independent program in execution that has its own memory space, resources, and system state.
    // It is isolated from other processes and communicates with them through inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.
    // A thread, on the other hand, is a smaller unit of execution within a process. Threads share the same memory space and resources
    //  of the parent process, allowing for more efficient communication and data sharing. Multiple threads within a process can run concurrently, enabling parallelism and improved performance for tasks that can be divided into smaller subtasks.

    //steps to troubleshoot rest api failure
    // 1. Check the API endpoint URL to ensure it is correct and accessible.
    // 2. Verify the request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) being used is appropriate for the API.
    // 3. Inspect the request headers and body to ensure they are properly formatted and contain the necessary information.
    // 4. Check the API documentation for any changes or updates that may affect the request
    // 5. Use tools like Postman or curl to test the API independently of the application.
    // 6. Review server logs for any error messages or issues that may indicate the cause of the failure.
    // 7. Check for network issues or firewall settings that may be blocking the request.
    // 8. If authentication is required, ensure that the correct credentials or tokens are being used.
    // 9. If the API is rate-limited, verify that the request frequency is within the allowed limits.
    // 10. Contact the API provider for support if the issue persists after troubleshooting.
